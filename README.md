# MULTIMODAL ADAPTIVE GRAPH EVOLUTION (MAGE) for Program Synthesis

This repository contains the necessary code to test [MAGE.jl](https://github.com/camilodlt/MAGE.jl) against all 25 [PSB2](https://github.com/thelmuth/psb2-python) problems. 

The package [SearchNetworks.jl](https://github.com/camilodlt/SearchNetworks.jl) is a dependency of MAGE.

The experiments published in the paper were run with the MAGE.jl package at this [commit](https://github.com/camilodlt/MAGE.jl/commit/a2373d1cbcd3dbad70bd37ec91acca00719391aa) in the history.

I will make updates to this repo to show showing the results.
